/*
 * Several ApplicationContext events are published and can be received by 
 * implementing Springâ€™s ApplicationListener interface:
 * 
 * BrokerAvailabilityEvent: Indicates when the broker becomes available or unavailable. 
 * 
 * SessionConnectEvent: Published when a new STOMP CONNECT is received to indicate 
 * the start of a new client session. The event contains the message that represents 
 * the connect, including the session ID, user information (if any), and any custom 
 * headers the client sent.
 * 
 * SessionConnectedEvent: Published shortly after a SessionConnectEvent 
 * when the broker has sent a STOMP CONNECTED frame in response to the CONNECT.
 *  At this point, the STOMP session can be considered fully established.
 *  
 *  SessionSubscribeEvent: Published when a new STOMP SUBSCRIBE is received.
 *
 *	SessionUnsubscribeEvent: Published when a new STOMP UNSUBSCRIBE is received.
 *
 *	SessionDisconnectEvent: Published when a STOMP session ends. 
 *	The DISCONNECT may have been sent from the client or it may be automatically generated 
 *	when the WebSocket session is closed. In some cases, this event is published more than 
 *	once per session. Components should be idempotent with regard to multiple disconnect 
 *	events.
